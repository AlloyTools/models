 * Birthday Book
 *
 * A classic Z example to explain the basic form of an Alloy model. For the original,
 * see J.M. Spivey, The Z Notation, Second Edition, Prentice Hall, 1992.
 *
 * A birthday book has two fields: known, a set of names (of persons whose birthdays are known),
 * and date, a function from known names to dates. The operation AddBirthday adds an association
 * between a name and a date; it uses the relational override operator (++), so any existing
 * mapping from the name to a date is replaced. DelBirthday removes the entry for a given name.
 * FindBirthday obtains the date d for a name n. The argument d is declared to be optional (that is,
 * a singleton or empty set), so if there is no entry for n, d will be empty. Remind gives the set
 * of names whose birthdays fall on a particular day.
 *
 * The assertion AddWorks says that if you add an entry, then look it up, you get back what you
 * just entered. DelIsUndo says that doing DelBirthday after AddBirthday undoes it, as if the add
 * had never happened. The first of these assertions is valid; the second isn't.
 *
 * The function BusyDay shows a case in which Remind produces more than one card.
