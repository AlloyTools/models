 * Towers of Hanoi model
 *
 * The Tower of Hanoi puzzle was invented by the French mathematician Edouard Lucas
 * in 1883. We are given a tower of eight disks, initially stacked in decreasing size on
 * one of three pegs. The objective is to transfer the entire tower to one of the other
 * pegs, moving only one disk at a time and never a larger one onto a smaller.
 *
 * The Alloy model below is written so that a solution to the model is a complete
 * sequence of valid moves solving an instance of the problem.  We define constraints
 * for the initial state (all discs on left stake), the final state (all discs on right stake),
 * and each pair of adjacent states (the top disc is moved from one stake to another,
 * not putting larger discs on smaller discs), and let Alloy Analyzer solve for the
 * sequence of states satisfying these constraints.  Since each adjacent pair of states is
 * constrained to be related by a single move, it is easy to see the sequence of moves
 * once you have the sequence of states.
 *
 * For n discs, 2^n states are needed for a solution
 *   (including the initial state and the final state).
 *
 * Performance: currently, the problem can be solved for up to 5 discs; this takes
 * several minutes with the Chaff solver.
