# Alloy Models
A public repository to host Alloy models. 

This repository holds public models to be used as entertainment, examples, tutorials, utilities, and proofs. All models are free to use and expand under the Apache 2 License.

We are actively seeking contributions and improvements. Just submit a PR, see the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the rules.

If you're not familiar with Github you can read [how to add a file to another repository](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) to find out how to add a _Pull Request_ (PR). (This is simpler than you think.)

You can also look at this [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vya039Ku64) that shows how to propose a new model.

To propose a change to an existing model, just click the file you want to change and edit it by clicking on the pen in the top right corner.
