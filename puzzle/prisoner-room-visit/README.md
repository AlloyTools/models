# Prisoners-Puzzle
This is an Alloy module for the prisoners puzzle

The warden of a prison gives his prisoners the following problem.
There is a room in the prison with two switches, labeled A and B.
Every so often, the warden will select a prisoner at random and take him into the room, where
he must flip (change the position of) exactly one of the switches.
The only guarantee he makes is that every prisoner will eventually
be brought into the room multiple times. 

At any time, any prisoner may declare that all the prisoners have 
been in the room at least once.  If that prisoner is right, then  
all the prisoners go free.  If he is wrong, all the prisoners are 
immediately executed.                                             
                                                                  
The prisoners are allowed to decide upon a strategy, after which  
they will not be allowed to communicate with one another.  And, of
course, they cannot see the room or who is being brought into it. 

What do they do?
